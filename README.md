All NCI-DOE jdacs4c training/testing or shareable data/metadata or publications (summary and links) are referenced under the 3 separate folders for pilot1, pilot2 and pilot3 respectively. 

NCI and FNLCR will coordinate with DOE labs to organize and help create a meaningful navigatable organizational hieararchy structure to ensure that data/metadata or related documentations can be found easily for the public.  Project specific sample testing data or metadata is stored and tracked under the above each pilot repostory.
